ASK_USER_QUESTION_TOOL_NAME = "AskUserQuestion"

EXIT_PLAN_MODE_V2_TOOL_PROMPT = f"""Use this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished writing your plan to the plan file and are ready for user approval.

## How This Tool Works
- You should have already written your plan to the plan file specified in the plan mode system message
- This tool does NOT take the plan content as a parameter - it will read the plan from the file you wrote
- This tool simply signals that you're done planning and ready for the user to review and approve
- The user will see the contents of your plan file when they review it

## When to Use This Tool
IMPORTANT: Only use this tool when the task requires planning the implementation steps of a task that requires writing code. For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.

## Before Using This Tool
Ensure your plan is complete and unambiguous:
- If you have unresolved questions about requirements or approach, use {ASK_USER_QUESTION_TOOL_NAME} first (in earlier phases)
- Once your plan is finalized, use THIS tool to request approval

**Important:** Do NOT use {ASK_USER_QUESTION_TOOL_NAME} to ask "Is this plan okay?" or "Should I proceed?" - that's exactly what THIS tool does. ExitPlanMode inherently requests user approval of your plan.

_WHAT_HAPPENS = f"""## What Happens in Plan Mode

In plan mode, you'll:
1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read tools
2. Understand existing patterns and architecture
3. Design an implementation approach
4. Present your plan to the user for approval
5. Use {ASK_USER_QUESTION_TOOL_NAME} if you need to clarify approaches
6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement

    """External (default) EnterPlanMode prompt."""
    wh = _WHAT_HAPPENS if include_what_happens else ""
    return f"""Use this tool proactively when you're about to start a non-trivial implementation task. Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.

## When to Use This Tool

**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:

1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality
2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways
3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure
4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies
5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files
6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope
7. **User Preferences Matter**: If you would use {ASK_USER_QUESTION_TOOL_NAME} to clarify the approach, use EnterPlanMode instead

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Only skip EnterPlanMode for simple tasks:
- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)
- Adding a single function with clear requirements
- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions
- Pure research/exploration tasks (use the Agent tool with explore agent instead)

{wh}## Important Notes

- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode
- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning - it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work
